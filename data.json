    "fullDescription": "<p>The 7.9\" Retina Display makes its debut on the iPad mini, maintaining its enormous 2048 x 1536 native resolution. At 326 pixels per inch, the Retina Display can show up to 3.1 million pixels at a time. The Retina Display is also a capacitive touchscreen so you'll be able to utilize all the multi-touch gestures of iOS 7. Its smaller form factor makes it easier to hold in one hand. The iPad mini comes in a silver finish.</p><p>Apple iPad Mini 4, 64GB WiFi+LTE Cellular ( Unlocked) Space Grey. New opened box. Received as a gift on Christmas the 25th and opened the box and did turn on the iPad to test it out but already have the Mini 3, they are not much different so I'm decided to let this one go and keeping the old one. The Apple factory warranty expiring on the 25th December 2016. Comes with unopened USB Charging cord, earpieces and original box. Shipping within USA & Canada. If you have any question, please do not hesitate to ask. Thanks for watching.</p>",

    "fullDescription": "<p>Grilling usually involves a significant amount of direct, radiant heat, and tends to be used for cooking meat quickly. Food to be grilled is cooked on a grill (an open wire grid such as a gridiron with a heat source above or below), a grill pan (similar to a frying pan, but with raised ridges to mimic the wires of an open grill), or griddle (a flat plate heated from below).</p><p>Direct heat grilling can expose food to temperatures often in excess of 260 °C (500 °F). Grilled meat acquires a distinctive roast aroma and flavor from a chemical process called the Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction only occurs when foods reach temperatures in excess of 155 °C (310 °F).</p>",
